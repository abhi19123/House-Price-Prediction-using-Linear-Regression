# House-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
Welcome to the repository , where I implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating house prices using key features. The steps involved are as follows:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gathered a dataset containing house prices along with their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values and outliers.
Feature Selection:

Selected relevant features (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms) based on their correlation with house prices.
Model Implementation:

Built a linear regression model using Python libraries such as scikit-learn.
Implemented the model using techniques like gradient descent.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
Fine-tuned the model to improve its accuracy.
